THIS IS ONLY FOR ADVANCED USER

To initialise speedups, you need to run init_speedup.py using python.

Before running the script make sure you cd to this directory.

And make sure you have rust fully installed.

Currently, this speed up will only work on linux,

and the optimization will take part only on some internal files.

After the successful build a new file called 'speedups.so' will be created in the previous directory, DO NOT DELETE IT.

You can delete the folder called 'target' after the successful build, it's just the cache, so no worries.
